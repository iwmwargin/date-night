# Date Night Recipe and Wine Pairing App

## Purpose
To provide the user with a quick food and wine pairing for a stay at home date night.  The user will input what kind of dish they would like to make and in return they will receive a few wine pairings as well as a recipe for the dish requested.

## Built With
* HTML 
* Bulma and CSS
* Javascript

## API's Used
* Spoonacular-Recipe-Food-Nutrition API
* Tasty API

## Issues
The app currently only produces the first recipe in the array and it would be great to randomize or pull multiple recipes in an attractive manner.
